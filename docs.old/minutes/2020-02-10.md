ATTENDANCE: ALL

## Agenda
- Went over Alexandru's game flow diagram, which illustrates the entire flow of the game through a single player's turn.

- Discussing different types of requirements (functional, non-functional, domain-specific). Product manager an dproject manager must decide on these together.

- Difficulty distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements.

- Decided on going for a top-down 2D design for the game, as 3D involves more development time than manageable. Using either:
	1. Board with graphics to maintain spirit of traditional Property Tycoon board game
	2. More minimal board with more space for tokens and other indicators, making a cleaner UI

- GUI idea to have mobile function as a controller for each player. The game renders on the local computer for every player to see, but interactions between each users and the game happen through the mobile interface. The mobile GUI's job is to show interactivity buttons like 'Buy' or 'Bid' dialogues and any more information needed.
